drivepolconvert
    writed a command file for CASA ending with:
    execfile(rpcpath [globals()])
    quit()

rcpath is runpolconvert.py which defines runPolConvert() and
assumes the polconvert function has been defined (via task_polconvert.py).

task_polconvert has checking that is moved to polconvert_standalone

today: polconvert_CASA, task_polconvert have different arguments for
    def polconvert...which then differ from standalone (PCONV).polconvert()

Step one is bumping all to 2.0.7 and converging on arguments.

### this might work
try:
    if bool(os.environ['CASASTANDALONE']):
        with open('polconvert_CASA.py', 'r') as file:
            code = file.read()
            print('using polconvert_CASA.py for task')
            # exec(object, globals=globals(), locals=locals())
            exec(code)
            sys.exit(0)
except:
    print('using task_polconvert.py for task')
